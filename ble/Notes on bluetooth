Notes on bluetooth 

1. I am using a broadcom-based bluetooth 4.0 USB dongle in the rpi. running "lsusb" returns the following line upon plug in of the dongle:

Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0a5c:21e8 Broadcom Corp.

2. run 'sudo apt-get -y install bluez' to get the linux bluetooth stack.
Also need 'sudo apt-get -y install python-gobject'

3. Reference pages for how to use bluetooth tool:

4. Pairing is done through the following steps:

a) 'hcitool dev' displays info about the local device (the dongle). Should return 2 things:

Devices:
	hci0	00:02:72:D9:F4:FC

b) place the device to connect in discovery/pairing mode.
Type 'hcitool scan'
it will respond something like
Scanning ...
	B8:F6:B1:0E:1D:FF	Fabien Papleuxâ€™s Keyboard
Type 'sudo bluez-simple-agent hci0 B8:F6:B1:0E:1D:FF'
It will display
